# üîí Working Features (DO NOT CHANGE)
- Messaging (DMs + threads) works correctly. Do not modify messaging logic or UI.
- Likes are functioning correctly.
- Feed sorting (Trending | Recent) is working.

# üõ†Ô∏è Patch Requests (Fix these issues only)

## 1. Home page
- Remove post creation/draft form from Home.
- Post creation must only exist in the **/create** route.
- Do not touch feed display logic (posts, likes, comments, saves remain as-is).

## 2. PostCard (Delete button)
- Place Delete button in the **top-right corner** of each PostCard.
- Clicking Delete should call the DELETE endpoint and remove the post from UI without requiring a refresh.
- Do not modify Like or Comment logic.

## 3. Comments
- After submitting a comment:
  - Comment count increments (this already works).
  - Display the list of comments **below the post body**.
- Each comment shows: **author username + body + timestamp**.
- Scope limited to comment rendering. Do not modify the post composer.

## 4. Jobs page
- Populate Jobs page with seeded job cards.
- Use the flip-card UI: 
  - Front: job title, company, tags, level, remote flag, salary, posted date.
  - Back: blurb, fake ‚ÄúApply‚Äù link, Save/Share buttons.
- Ensure jobs render correctly on `/jobs`.

### Seed Data Reminder
- Update the Prisma seed script to include multiple **Job records** with realistic fake data:
  - Title, company, salary range, tags, level, location, remote flag, posted date, short blurb, and fake Apply link.
- Verify that seeded jobs appear on the Jobs page after running `prisma db seed`.

## 5. Profile navigation
- Enable navigation from Profile to other screens (Home, Jobs, Create, Inbox).
- Fix routing so Profile does not trap the user.

## 6. Drafts
- Save drafts to the database and display them in Profile under a **Drafts section**.
- Allow resuming/editing a draft from Profile.
- Publishing a draft moves it into the main Posts list.

## 7. Username update
- When changing username in Profile settings:
  - Update the database record.
  - Reflect new username across posts, comments, and profile immediately.
- Ensure uniqueness check remains enforced.

## 8. Message badges
- Current bug: unread badge does not decrease after reading a message.
- Fix logic so:
  - When a thread is opened, all messages in that thread are marked **read**.
  - The unread badge for that thread disappears immediately.
  - The overall Inbox tab badge disappears once all threads are read.
- Do not change any other messaging behavior.

## 9. Navigation menus (critical for desktop demo)
- Bottom navigation bar should appear at the **bottom of the screen on both mobile and desktop**.
- Current bug: nav appears at the top on desktop.
- Fix styling/layout so that:
  - On desktop, bottom nav is pinned to the bottom of the viewport.
  - On mobile, keep bottom nav pinned to the bottom (already working).
- Do not move or duplicate nav to the top of the screen.
