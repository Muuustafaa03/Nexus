# üîí Working Features (DO NOT CHANGE)
- Bottom navigation bar is correctly visible on the Inbox screen. Keep it pinned at the bottom on all screens.
- Post delete works correctly (removes from DB and UI). Do not alter delete behavior.

# üêõ Bug Fix Requests (Fix only these)

## 1) Profile: Published posts not showing
- Current bug: Published posts created by the logged-in user do not appear on their Profile.
- Expected:
  - Profile should display a list/grid of the **user‚Äôs published posts** (exclude drafts).
  - When a post is published, it should immediately be visible on the author‚Äôs Profile without refresh.
- Implementation guidance:
  - Ensure the Profile data fetch filters by `authorId = currentUserId` AND `isDraft = false`.
  - Confirm server route returns these posts and the client renders them.

## 2) Comments: Not visible
- Current bug: Cannot view comments on posts.
- Expected:
  - When opening a post OR after submitting a comment, show a **comments list below the post body**.
  - Each comment displays: **author username + comment body** (no timestamp needed).
  - Comment count already increments; keep that intact.
- Implementation guidance:
  - Add/fix the fetch for comments by `postId` and render the list below the post body.
  - After submit, append the new comment to the list (no full reload required).

## 3) Branding: Portal logo inconsistent
- Current bug: The Portal logo is empty/different on some screens compared to the login screen.
- Expected:
  - Use a **single, consistent Portal logo/wordmark** across the entire app (login, Home, Jobs, Create, Inbox, Profile).
- Implementation guidance:
  - Centralize the logo asset (e.g., `/assets/portal-logo.svg` or a shared component) and reference the **same asset/component** on all pages.
  - Remove any duplicate/mismatched logo assets.

# ‚úÖ After applying fixes, verify:
- Create and publish a post ‚Üí it appears on Profile immediately.
- Open a post with existing comments ‚Üí comments list is visible with author + body.
- Add a new comment ‚Üí it shows in the list right away; count increments.
- Logo looks identical on Login and all main screens.
- Inbox bottom nav and delete behavior remain unchanged.
