Portal (now called Nexus) is a social creation app I built to make it easier for people to share ideas, find opportunities, and connect. I put together core features like AI-assisted content creation, a jobs board, direct messaging, and a feed with trending/recent sorting using React, TypeScript, Tailwind, Prisma, and the OpenAI API.

Along the way, I ran user testing sessions, gathered feedback, and made design changes to keep things simple and intuitive. Honestly, one of the most fun parts was jumping between building the tech and shaping the product, from writing code to thinking through user flows and how everything fits together.

Here is a demo if you're interested in seeing how it works!
